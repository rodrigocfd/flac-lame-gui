FLAC/LAME frontend

I tried many GUIs to manage the command line versions of FLAC and LAME, and I disliked all them. So I wrote my own. Particularly, this one performs the conversions of many files simultaneously in parallel threads, taking advantage of multi-core CPUs.

This program is pure C, and it uses nothing but Win32.
